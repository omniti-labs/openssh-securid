Seems like a few people are interested.  So here is the patch.

This has only been tested on UNICIES that support PAM.  There is untested
(only 5 lines) code in auth-passwd.c that should provide the same
functionality for normal (non-PAM) password verifications.

The patch is logical quite small, the physical patch bulky because it contains
all the line number changes in "configure" after running autoconf on the
modified configure.in file (in which I changed maybe 10 lines -- Yuk.)

The sshd man page has been patched too :-)  Read it for the two new options
relating to SecurID.

How it works:

0) apply patch ;-)  You must use GNU patch (get it from ftp.gnu.org, it free.)
1) copy ACE headers (in SecurID inc directory) into either a standard
   include place (like /usr/local/include) or into the openssh source tree or add
   the --with-cflags=-I/path/to/ace/inc (where the include files are located)
2) copy the libaceclnt.a (for ACE 5.X) or sdiclient.a (for ACE <= 4.X) for your
   OS (from /path/to/ace/lib/<arch>) into the openssh source tree.

Make sure that /var/ace contains your sdconf.rec, etc.  If you installed
SecurID client or server on a machine it should be this way already.  If you
used a non-standard install location do a "ln -s /path/to/ace/data /var/ace"

3) add --with-securid to the configure flags for new ACE 5.X support.  Use
   --with-securid-old for ACE API version 4.X and older.

It will trigger if a user has a shell in /etc/passwd that ends with "sdshell"
and it snags your shell the same way sdshell does.  Users with other shells
will log in as if SecurID didn't exist.

Done:
  o Normal passcode verification
  o Enter next token for verification
    (use ssh -v to see the *useful* debgging messages)

ssh -v will let you know if:
 o your code was accepted.
 o your code was rejected.
 o you are required to wait for the next token and enter that.

TODO:
  o Handle PIN creation and changing (as their are by default three log in
attempts, it should be straight forward to integrate in these additions --
both of these operations require exactly three user inputs.)
  o Add sshd_config parameter to specify the VAR_ACE location (forced to
/var/ace OR VAR_ACE environment variable now.)

DISCLAIMER:
  I works for me (yes, in production).  If you get locked out of a production
system becuase you replaced your sshd with this one, feeling really dumb is
YOUR responsibility NOT mine.  It is not my fault :-D

Hope this is useful! scp (and all other tools that can use ssh like rsync and
cvs) will work now!!!! Hooray!
